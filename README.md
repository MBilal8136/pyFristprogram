# How to Run the Program

To run the Python program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Python file is located. For example:
   ```sh
   cd /G:/working/python/first\ pro/
   ```
3. Run the Python file using the Python interpreter. For example:
   ```sh
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file.
